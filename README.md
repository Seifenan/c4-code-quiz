# Web APIs-C4: Code Quiz

This is a responsive **Quiz** that will provide feedback with each question response, and allows user to save or reset highscores. 

## Rules of the Quiz
* You are alloted **75 Seconds** to answer **5 Questions**. 
* Each incorrect response will trigger:
  - "Wrong!" alert to **pop-up**.
  - Countdown time will turn **red**.
  - Deduction of **10 Seconds** off your remaining time!
* Correct responces will trigger:
  - Countdown timer will turn **green**.
  - Keep in mind; the timer will **NOT** stop or will **NOT** add time for correct responses!
* If time runs out, your score will be **Zero** (0).
* The **faster** you answer questions **correctly**, the **higher** your **score** will be!

## Good Luck!

>I was tasked with creating a Quiz that lasts 75 seconds, and presents 5 different questions to the user. Each response would trigger either the display of the next question, or reduce time by 10 seconds, then proceed to the next question.
